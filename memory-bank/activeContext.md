# Active Context

### Current Focus
- ✅ COMPLETED: Full MCP server implementation with Railway deployment
- ✅ COMPLETED: Modal integration with LangDB offloading 
- ✅ COMPLETED: o4-mini-high model compatibility with max_completion_tokens
- ✅ COMPLETED: Rich LangDB response parsing and tool recommendations
- ✅ COMPLETED: Automatic LANGDB environment variable integration

### Recent Changes
- Initialized memory-bank with core documents
- Captured architecture, modules, and env requirements
- Scaffolded TS Fastify server with SSE + stub stdio
- Added endpoints: `/health`, `/capabilities`, `/sequential`
- Implemented in-memory sequential-thinking state and endpoints:
  - `/process_thought`, `/generate_summary`, `/clear_history`, minimal `/run`
- Implemented JSON-RPC streamable HTTP root (`/`) with methods: `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, `notifications/initialized` (204)
- Added `server-info`, `GET /` and `/sse` to stream; fixed 404s
- Deployed Modal GPU app (`mcp_gpu_tasks`), webhook to Railway, HMAC verification
- Pushed repository to GitHub; added Cursor MCP config entry
- Provider switch stub added (`src/provider.ts`) with env-based defaults; SSE streams via provider stub
- Removed `auto`/`auto_chain` paths to align with per-step parity
- Matched protocolVersion to `2025-06-18` and corrected `inputSchema` casing
- Compared behavior with third-party `sequentialthinking-tools`; documented no standard auto-chain field
 - Implemented diagnostic plan for LangDB endpoint failures
   - Converted `/diag/langdb` from GET to POST for JSON payload handling
   - Added robust validation/logging (raw body logging, empty/invalid payload handling, increased default timeout)
   - Introduced GET fallback for `/diag/langdb` that hints proper POST usage
   - Added `/routes` endpoint to print registered routes for debugging
   - Fixed TypeScript body typing via `DiagLangdbBody` interface
   - Ensured build passes (`pnpm build`) and pushed to GitHub (`main`, commit `03ad2f1`)

# Cursor compatibility + LangDB via Modal (latest)
- Increased synchronous wait window in `src/router.ts` to 120s; Modal function timeout to 1800s in `modal_app.py`.
- Defaulted model to `gpt-4o-mini` for faster completions; simplified system prompt to return only 3 JSON steps.
- Wrapped tool results for `tools/call` in `content[]` with a single `{ type: 'text', text: stringifiedPayload }` block for both completed and accepted paths (prevents Cursor hang).
- Added `scripts/poll_job_result.js` to manually poll `/modal/job/:id` when Cursor receives an accepted response.
- Verified end-to-end in Cursor with `use_langdb: true` returning synchronous results; example `correlation_id` observed in logs.

## Diagnostics (this session)
- Verified `/diag/langdb` POST with minimal and valid payloads
- Confirmed GET now returns a 405-style hint with example POST body
- Added `/routes` for route auditing; confirmed route registration order and presence

### Validation (this session)
- Repo pushed to GitHub (`main`)
- In-Cursor test: invoked `sequential_thinking` three times; each returned `{ ok: true, status: "recorded" }`
 - Added `/diag` and `/diag/langdb`; verified env presence and active LangDB probe
 - Implemented Modal-offloaded LangDB flow; tool now returns `{ status: "accepted", correlation_id, poll }` then final via webhook
  - Applied Cursor-compat response mapping (content[] text); Cursor now shows final results synchronously when within the 120s window

### Major Achievements (Current Session)
1. ✅ **Modal Integration Fixed**: Resolved automatic LangDB offloading via LANGDB env var
2. ✅ **o4-mini-high Compatibility**: Fixed max_completion_tokens parameter for o1-series models  
3. ✅ **Rich Response Parsing**: LangDB step descriptions now properly extracted and returned
4. ✅ **Automatic Configuration**: LANGDB=true in mcp.json enables Modal by default
5. ✅ **Enhanced Tool Recommendations**: LangDB steps converted to intelligent tool suggestions
6. ✅ **Complete Testing**: End-to-end validation with rich responses and Modal processing metadata
7. ✅ **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of Modal offload decisions and result processing
8. ✅ **Admin Backend Architecture**: FastAPI analytics backend with SSE and request logging middleware
9. ✅ **Analytics Integration**: Tool auto-sends analytics to Railway via bearer or ingest key
10. ✅ **Dashboard**: SvelteKit dashboard mounted at `/dashboard`, live KPIs via SSE, Vite proxy for dev CORS-free

### Current Status
- **Production Ready**: Full Railway deployment with Modal GPU processing
- **Model Working**: o4-mini-high with max_completion_tokens parameter support
- **Integration Complete**: Railway ↔ Modal ↔ LangDB pipeline operational
- **Response Quality**: Rich, detailed, comprehensive output with progress tracking
- **Admin Backend**: Complete FastAPI admin backend for analytics and monitoring
- **Data Collection**: Comprehensive analytics tracking integrated into MCP server
- **Cost Tracking**: Full end-to-end cost tracking implemented and verified, with Modal reporting costs to Railway analytics.
- **Liquid Glass Admin Dashboard**: Fully implemented UI/UX redesign with Apple's "Liquid Glass" aesthetic, including dynamic components, advanced visualizations, and comprehensive error/performance handling.
- **Frontend & Backend Stability**: All identified build and runtime errors (including CORS, API connection, and data handling) resolved across both frontend and backend services.
- **FastAPI Startup & Backend Reliability**: Resolved all startup crashes (`NameError`, `TypeError`) and critical backend 500 errors, ensuring the FastAPI application starts reliably and serves data correctly.
- **Dashboard Data Integrity**: Fixed `AttributeError` for performance metrics, ensuring all dashboard charts display accurate and real-time data.

### Decisions & Considerations
- Keep state in-memory initially; add persistence later if needed
- Prefer streamable HTTP via mcp-remote compatibility
- No standard JSON-RPC field to force client follow-up; client (Agent) drives chaining
- Align tool response shape with third-party parity to avoid client confusion
- Cursor expects `content[]` blocks; returning raw custom fields may lead to hidden/ignored results.
