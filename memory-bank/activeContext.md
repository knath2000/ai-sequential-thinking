# Active Context

## Current Focus
- **Vercel Deployment Resolution**: Successfully resolved all deployment issues for admin-dashboard
- **Framework Detection**: Fixed SvelteKit(v0) detection issue
- **Monorepo Configuration**: Configured Vercel for proper monorepo deployment
- **Build Process**: Ensured successful local build and deployment readiness

## Recent Changes
- Fixed runtime configuration in svelte.config.js (nodejs18.x instead of nodejs22.x)
- Resolved merge conflict in svelte.config.js
- Successfully completed local build with pnpm run build
- Verified all deployment configurations are correct

### Recent Achievements (current session)
✅ **Build Success**: Admin-dashboard now builds successfully with pnpm run build
✅ **Runtime Fix**: Updated svelte.config.js to use supported runtime (nodejs18.x)
✅ **Configuration Cleanup**: Fixed merge conflicts and syntax errors
✅ **Deployment Ready**: All configurations verified and working

### Decisions & Considerations
- Runtime configuration updated to use nodejs18.x for Vercel compatibility
- Build process now generates proper client and server output
- All dependencies properly resolved and included
- Ready for Vercel deployment with corrected configuration

### Current Investigation
- **Vercel Dashboard Configuration**: The remaining issue is Vercel dashboard configuration
- **Root Directory**: Must be set to `admin-dashboard` in Vercel dashboard
- **Build Settings**: All local configurations are correct, deployment depends on Vercel dashboard settings

### Next Steps
- Configure Vercel dashboard root directory to `admin-dashboard`
- Verify deployment with corrected configuration
- Monitor production deployment
