### Completed
- TS Fastify server with SSE + stdio stub and JSON-RPC root
- Endpoints: `/health`, `/capabilities`, `/sequential`, `/server-info`, `/sse`, JSON-RPC `/`
- In-memory sequential-thinking: `/process_thought`, `/generate_summary`, `/clear_history`, `/run`
- Modal GPU app deployed with webhook (HMAC) and local smoke tests
- Cursor MCP config updated; server integrated
- Finalized per-step behavior parity: removed `auto` and `auto_chain` from JSON-RPC; minimal per-step returns
- Guardrails added: rate limiting, input caps, structured error objects
- Fixed protocol compliance: `protocolVersion` and `inputSchema` casing
- Repository pushed to GitHub: `https://github.com/knath2000/ai-sequential-thinking` (`main`)
- In-Cursor validation: 3 `sequential_thinking` tool calls recorded successfully
- Added `/diag/langdb` endpoint for LangDB diagnostics
- Added `/routes` endpoint for route auditing
- Added `/debug/cost-tracking` and `/debug/test-cost-logging` endpoints for debugging
- Added `session_id` column to `performance_metrics` table in NeonDB.
- Updated Railway build configuration to correctly build and serve `admin-dashboard` static files.
- End-to-End Cost Tracking Verified: Confirmed successful flow of cost data from Modal to Railway analytics and its display in NeonDB and the dashboard.
- Enhanced Debugging Infrastructure: Added debug endpoints and enhanced logging to aid troubleshooting.
- ✅ **Vercel Deployment Fixed**: Resolved monorepo root directory configuration issue

### Resolved Issues (Current Chat Session)
- ✅ **Modal Cost Data Gap**: Resolved the issue where Modal costs were not being communicated back to Railway analytics.
- ✅ **Missing `session_id` in DB**: Fixed the database schema mismatch for `performance_metrics` table.
- ✅ **Static File Serving Errors**: Corrected Railway build process to ensure dashboard static files are properly served.
- ✅ **Environment Variable Propagation (Modal)**: Ensured `RAILWAY_ANALYTICS_URL` and `RAILWAY_ANALYTICS_KEY` are correctly passed to Modal worker.
- ✅ **Vercel Monorepo Issue**: Fixed Vercel deployment by setting root directory to `admin-dashboard`

### Session Achievements (Current Chat Session)
1. ✅ **Liquid Glass Admin Dashboard Redesign Implemented**: Completed the UI/UX overhaul of the admin dashboard with Apple's "Liquid Glass" design language, including glassmorphic components, dark theme, and dynamic gradients.
2. ✅ **All Frontend Build Issues Resolved**: Fixed CSS import paths, SvelteKit prop warnings, Chart.js null data errors, HMR issues, and suppressed development warnings, ensuring a clean and successful build.
3. ✅ **Backend Exception Handler Enhanced**: Implemented a global exception handler in FastAPI to manually add CORS headers to error responses and enabled debug mode for improved visibility.
4. ✅ **API Connection Stability**: Enhanced SSE and fetchJson functions with robust error handling and retry logic for reliable backend communication.
5. ✅ **End-to-End Cost Tracking Verified**: Successfully integrated Modal cost reporting to Railway analytics, with full data flow from LangDB/Modal to NeonDB and dashboard display.
6. ✅ **Database Schema Fixed**: Corrected `session_id` column in `performance_metrics` table, resolving critical analytics insertion failures.
7. ✅ **Vercel Deployment Success**: Successfully resolved monorepo configuration issue and deployed admin-dashboard to Vercel

### Resolved Issues (Current Chat Session)
- ✅ **Dashboard UI/UX**: Transformed the dashboard to a modern Liquid Glass design.
- ✅ **Build Errors**: Eliminated all frontend build errors and warnings.
- ✅ **Runtime Errors**: Fixed all identified runtime issues, including data type errors and prop warnings.
- ✅ **CORS + 500 Errors**: Resolved backend CORS issues by implementing manual CORS headers in the exception handler and debugging the underlying 500 error.
- ✅ **API Connectivity**: Improved reliability of API connections with retry mechanisms.
- ✅ **Vercel Deployment**: Fixed monorepo root directory configuration

### Session Achievements (Current Chat Session)
1. ✅ **FastAPI Application Startup Fixed**: Resolved `NameError` and `TypeError` crashes during FastAPI application startup by correctly ordering middleware registration and ensuring Python 3.9 type hint compatibility.
2. ✅ **AttributeError in Performance Metrics Resolved**: Fixed `AttributeError: PerformanceMetric has no attribute 'response_time_ms'` by modifying `analytics.py` to correctly query `PerformanceMetric.metric_value` and filtering by `metric_name`.
3. ✅ **All Backend API Errors Resolved**: Successfully debugged and fixed underlying 500 errors in backend API endpoints, ensuring proper data retrieval and functionality.
4. ✅ **CORS Handling Enhanced**: Implemented a robust global exception handler in FastAPI to manually add CORS headers to error responses, resolving frontend CORS issues.
5. ✅ **Liquid Glass Admin Dashboard Fully Functional**: Completed the UI/UX overhaul, and all previously identified build and runtime errors have been resolved, ensuring a fully functional and redesigned dashboard.
6. ✅ **API Connection Robustness**: Enhanced SSE and `fetchJson` functions with comprehensive error handling and retry logic for stable frontend-backend communication.
7. ✅ **Vercel Deployment Success**: Successfully deployed admin-dashboard to Vercel after fixing monorepo configuration

### Resolved Issues (Current Chat Session)
- ✅ **Railway Startup Crash**: Resolved `NameError: name 'app' is not defined` and `TypeError` during FastAPI application startup.
- ✅ **`response_time_ms` AttributeError**: Fixed `AttributeError: PerformanceMetric has no attribute 'response_time_ms'` in analytics service.
- ✅ **CORS 500 Errors**: Eliminated CORS errors caused by backend 500 responses missing `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers.
- ✅ **Frontend Build Errors**: All frontend build errors and warnings (including CSS import, Chart.js null data, unknown props, source maps, favicon, HMR) are now resolved.
- ✅ **Dashboard UI/UX Functionality**: The Liquid Glass design is fully implemented and interactive with real-time data display.
- ✅ **Vercel Monorepo Issue**: Fixed Vercel deployment configuration for monorepo structure

### Current Investigation
- ✅ **Vercel Serverless Function Crash**: Successfully resolved `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `@sveltejs/kit` at runtime in Vercel's serverless environment
- ✅ **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified monorepo structure issue where Vercel was building root project instead of admin-dashboard
- ✅ **Fix Applied**: Configured Vercel root directory to `admin-dashboard` for proper SvelteKit build process
- ✅ **Deployment Status**: Vercel deployment now passes successfully

### Next Steps
- ✅ **Vercel Deployment**: Successfully resolved and deployed
- Consider adding DI framework (tsyringe) for better modularity
- Expand unit test coverage for new modules
- Document lessons learned for future Vercel deployments
