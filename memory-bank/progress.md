# Progress

### Status
- Memory bank initialized
- Plan grounded and captured in context docs
- Project scaffolded; server running locally

### Completed
- TS Fastify server with SSE + stdio stub and JSON-RPC root
- Endpoints: `/health`, `/capabilities`, `/sequential`, `/server-info`, `/sse`, JSON-RPC `/`
- In-memory sequential-thinking: `/process_thought`, `/generate_summary`, `/clear_history`, `/run`
- Modal GPU app deployed with webhook (HMAC) and local smoke tests
- Cursor MCP config updated; server integrated
- Finalized per-step behavior parity: removed `auto` and `auto_chain` from JSON-RPC; minimal per-step returns
- Guardrails added: rate limiting, input caps, structured error objects
- Fixed protocol compliance: `protocolVersion` and `inputSchema` casing
- Repository pushed to GitHub: `https://github.com/knath2000/ai-sequential-thinking` (`main`)
- In-Cursor validation: 3 `sequential_thinking` tool calls recorded successfully
- Added diagnostics endpoints `/diag` and `/diag/langdb`
- Modal-only LangDB integration with webhook + optional sync wait; Modal app deployed; submit URL configured
- Tool call now supports `use_langdb:true` to offload via Modal (returns accepted + poll or final with source: "langdb")
- GitHub pushes for all changes
 - Increased sync window (120s) and Modal timeout (1800s); simplified prompt/model for faster LangDB calls
 - Cursor-compatible results: tool responses now wrapped in `content[]` text for both completed/accepted
 - Added `scripts/poll_job_result.js` for manual polling when clients donâ€™t auto-poll

### Next
 - CI: add GitHub Actions to deploy Modal on push to `main`
 - Add MCP tool to fetch session `generate_summary`
 - End-to-end logs verification on LangDB dashboard after Modal callback
  - Optionally expose `/modal/job/:id` usage snippet in README for external polling clients

### Known Issues
- No standard JSON-RPC field to force client auto-follow-up; rely on Agent mode or single-call auto
 - Some clients may still not poll on accepted; use poll script as a workaround
