## ðŸ”„ Next Steps Required

**CRITICAL: Vercel Dashboard Configuration Required**

The `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: @sveltejs/kit` error will persist until the following is configured in the Vercel dashboard:

1. **Root Directory**: Must be set to `admin-dashboard` (currently building from repository root)
2. **Build Command**: `pnpm run build`
3. **Install Command**: `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile`
4. **Framework Preset**: SvelteKit

### ðŸ“‹ Deployment Checklist
