# Progress

### Status
- ✅ **PRODUCTION COMPLETE**: Full MCP server with Modal integration deployed
- ✅ **MODEL COMPATIBILITY**: o4-mini-high working with proper parameter support
- ✅ **RICH RESPONSES**: LangDB step descriptions properly parsed and enhanced
- ✅ **AUTO-CONFIGURATION**: LANGDB environment variable enabling Modal by default

### Completed
- TS Fastify server with SSE + stdio stub and JSON-RPC root
- Endpoints: `/health`, `/capabilities`, `/sequential`, `/server-info`, `/sse`, JSON-RPC `/`
- In-memory sequential-thinking: `/process_thought`, `/generate_summary`, `/clear_history`, `/run`
- Modal GPU app deployed with webhook (HMAC) and local smoke tests
- Cursor MCP config updated; server integrated
- Finalized per-step behavior parity: removed `auto` and `auto_chain` from JSON-RPC; minimal per-step returns
- Guardrails added: rate limiting, input caps, structured error objects
- Fixed protocol compliance: `protocolVersion` and `inputSchema` casing
- Repository pushed to GitHub: `https://github.com/knath2000/ai-sequential-thinking` (`main`)
- In-Cursor validation: 3 `sequential_thinking` tool calls recorded successfully
- Added diagnostics endpoints `/diag` and `/diag/langdb`
- Modal-only LangDB integration with webhook + optional sync wait; Modal app deployed; submit URL configured
- Tool call now supports `use_langdb:true` to offload via Modal (returns accepted + poll or final with source: "langdb")
- GitHub pushes for all changes
 - Increased sync window (120s) and Modal timeout (1800s); simplified prompt/model for faster LangDB calls
 - Cursor-compatible results: tool responses now wrapped in `content[]` text for both completed/accepted
 - Added `scripts/poll_job_result.js` for manual polling when clients don’t auto-poll
 - `/diag/langdb` diagnostics hardened:
  - Switched to POST for payload handling; added GET fallback with usage hint
  - Added `/routes` debug endpoint
  - Request body validation, raw body logging, and increased default timeout (30s)
  - Fixed TypeScript typing via `DiagLangdbBody`; verified build success (`pnpm build`)

### Optional Future Enhancements
- CI: add GitHub Actions to deploy Modal on push to `main`
- Add MCP tool to fetch session `generate_summary`
- Add automated tests for different payload scenarios

### Resolved Issues (This Session)
- ✅ **Modal Integration**: Fixed automatic offloading via LANGDB environment variable
- ✅ **o4-mini-high Parameters**: Resolved max_tokens error with max_completion_tokens implementation
- ✅ **Response Parsing**: Fixed Modal result processing to return rich LangDB data
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Resolved propagation issues with always-on Modal logic

### Remaining Known Issues
- No standard JSON-RPC field to force client auto-follow-up (design limitation)
- Some clients may still not poll on accepted responses (workaround available)

### Session Achievements (Current Chat Session)
1.  ✅ **`sessionDetail` ReferenceError Fixed**: Resolved variable name mismatch in `SessionsTable.svelte` to correctly pass `selectedSession` as `sessionDetail` prop.
2.  ✅ **Modal Worker Switched to CPU**: Reconfigured `modal_app.py` to remove GPU usage, defaulting the Modal worker to CPU, and deployed successfully.
3.  ✅ **Comprehensive Error Logging Implemented**: Integrated centralized error logging in `src/router.ts`, `admin-backend/app/db/database.py`, and created `admin-dashboard/src/lib/components/ErrorBoundary.svelte` for client-side logging, ensuring all errors are captured in NeonDB.
4.  ✅ **Circular Dependency Resolved**: Fixed `ImportError` by introducing `admin-backend/app/db/base.py` and updating imports in `admin-backend/app/db/database.py`, `admin-backend/app/models/analytics.py`, `admin-backend/app/main.py`, and `admin-backend/app/db/__init__.py`.
5.  ✅ **`sequential_thinking` Tool Invocation Documented**: Detailed how the `sequential_thinking` tool was called directly within Cursor using its programmatic interface, bypassing terminal or manual UI interaction, and demonstrated intentional error triggering.

### Resolved Issues (Current Chat Session)
-   ✅ **`sessionDetail` ReferenceError**: Fixed `sessionDetail` not defined issue in `SessionsTable.svelte`.
-   ✅ **Modal GPU Usage**: Switched Modal worker from GPU to CPU.
-   ✅ **Error Logging Gap**: Implemented comprehensive error logging across the application stack to NeonDB.
-   ✅ **Circular Import**: Resolved circular dependency between `app.main`, `app.db.database`, `app.services.analytics`, and `app.models.analytics`.

### Session Achievements (Current Chat Session)
1.  ✅ **Modal Cost Reporting Implemented**: Integrated cost calculation and reporting from Modal worker to Railway analytics, ensuring LangDB and Modal costs are tracked.
2.  ✅ **Railway Analytics Endpoint for Costs**: Created a dedicated endpoint `/internal/modal-cost-callback` on Railway to receive and log cost data from Modal.
3.  ✅ **Modal Worker Configuration**: Updated Modal worker to include `railway-analytics` secret and pass `RAILWAY_ANALYTICS_URL` and `RAILWAY_ANALYTICS_KEY` to the payload.
4.  ✅ **Database Schema Fixed**: Successfully added `session_id` column to `performance_metrics` table in NeonDB.
5.  ✅ **Railway Build Process Enhanced**: Updated Railway build configuration to correctly build and serve `admin-dashboard` static files.
6.  ✅ **End-to-End Cost Tracking Verified**: Confirmed successful flow of cost data from Modal to Railway analytics and its display in NeonDB and the dashboard.
7.  ✅ **Enhanced Debugging Infrastructure**: Added debug endpoints (`/debug/cost-tracking`, `/debug/test-cost-logging`) and enhanced logging to aid troubleshooting.

### Resolved Issues (Current Chat Session)
-   ✅ **Modal Cost Data Gap**: Resolved the issue where Modal costs were not being communicated back to Railway analytics.
-   ✅ **Missing `session_id` in DB**: Fixed the database schema mismatch for `performance_metrics` table.
-   ✅ **Static File Serving Errors**: Corrected Railway build process to ensure dashboard static files are properly served.
-   ✅ **Environment Variable Propagation (Modal)**: Ensured `RAILWAY_ANALYTICS_URL` and `RAILWAY_ANALYTICS_KEY` are correctly passed to Modal worker.

### Session Achievements (Current Chat Session)
1.  ✅ **Liquid Glass Admin Dashboard Redesign Implemented**: Completed the UI/UX overhaul of the admin dashboard with Apple's "Liquid Glass" design language, including glassmorphic components, dark theme, and dynamic gradients.
2.  ✅ **All Frontend Build Issues Resolved**: Fixed CSS import paths, SvelteKit prop warnings, Chart.js null data errors, HMR issues, and suppressed development warnings, ensuring a clean and successful build.
3.  ✅ **Backend Exception Handler Enhanced**: Implemented a global exception handler in FastAPI to manually add CORS headers to error responses and enabled debug mode for improved visibility.
4.  ✅ **API Connection Stability**: Enhanced SSE and fetchJson functions with robust error handling and retry logic for reliable backend communication.
5.  ✅ **End-to-End Cost Tracking Verified**: Successfully integrated Modal cost reporting to Railway analytics, with full data flow from LangDB/Modal to NeonDB and dashboard display.
6.  ✅ **Database Schema Fixed**: Corrected `session_id` column in `performance_metrics` table, resolving critical analytics insertion failures.

### Resolved Issues (Current Chat Session)
