# Progress

### Status
- ✅ **PRODUCTION COMPLETE**: Full MCP server with Modal integration deployed
- ✅ **MODEL COMPATIBILITY**: o4-mini-high working with proper parameter support
- ✅ **RICH RESPONSES**: LangDB step descriptions properly parsed and enhanced
- ✅ **AUTO-CONFIGURATION**: LANGDB environment variable enabling Modal by default

### Completed
- TS Fastify server with SSE + stdio stub and JSON-RPC root
- Endpoints: `/health`, `/capabilities`, `/sequential`, `/server-info`, `/sse`, JSON-RPC `/`
- In-memory sequential-thinking: `/process_thought`, `/generate_summary`, `/clear_history`, `/run`
- Modal GPU app deployed with webhook (HMAC) and local smoke tests
- Cursor MCP config updated; server integrated
- Finalized per-step behavior parity: removed `auto` and `auto_chain` from JSON-RPC; minimal per-step returns
- Guardrails added: rate limiting, input caps, structured error objects
- Fixed protocol compliance: `protocolVersion` and `inputSchema` casing
- Repository pushed to GitHub: `https://github.com/knath2000/ai-sequential-thinking` (`main`)
- In-Cursor validation: 3 `sequential_thinking` tool calls recorded successfully
- Added diagnostics endpoints `/diag` and `/diag/langdb`
- Modal-only LangDB integration with webhook + optional sync wait; Modal app deployed; submit URL configured
- Tool call now supports `use_langdb:true` to offload via Modal (returns accepted + poll or final with source: "langdb")
- GitHub pushes for all changes
 - Increased sync window (120s) and Modal timeout (1800s); simplified prompt/model for faster LangDB calls
 - Cursor-compatible results: tool responses now wrapped in `content[]` text for both completed/accepted
 - Added `scripts/poll_job_result.js` for manual polling when clients don’t auto-poll
 - `/diag/langdb` diagnostics hardened:
  - Switched to POST for payload handling; added GET fallback with usage hint
  - Added `/routes` debug endpoint
  - Request body validation, raw body logging, and increased default timeout (30s)
  - Fixed TypeScript typing via `DiagLangdbBody`; verified build success (`pnpm build`)

### Session Achievements (Jan 15, 2025)
### Session Achievements (Aug 16, 2025)
1. **Live Dashboard**: SvelteKit app with Tailwind/Flowbite, mounted at `/dashboard`, SSE KPIs working
2. **CORS-Free Dev**: Vite proxy `/api` → Railway and default API base to `/api`
3. **SSE Endpoint**: `/api/v1/analytics/stream` added; snapshot at `/dashboard` tiles updates live
4. **Auth for Analytics**: Ingest header `X-Analytics-Ingest-Key` accepted; bearer optional
5. **Tool Analytics Client**: Defaults to Railway URL; sends bearer or ingest header automatically
6. **Logging**: Request logging middleware added; Railway logs now show REQ/RES for analytics POSTs

1. **Modal Integration Resolution**: Fixed environment variable propagation issue by implementing always-on Modal logic
2. **o4-mini-high Model Support**: Resolved max_tokens parameter error by implementing max_completion_tokens for o1-series models
3. **Rich Response Processing**: Fixed Modal result parsing to extract and return complete LangDB step descriptions
4. **Enhanced Tool Recommendations**: LangDB steps now converted to intelligent tool suggestions with rationales
5. **Debug Infrastructure**: Added comprehensive logging for Modal offload decisions and result processing
6. **End-to-End Validation**: Complete testing pipeline with rich responses and modal processing metadata
7. **Production Deployment**: All fixes deployed to Railway with GitHub auto-deployment

### Optional Future Enhancements
- CI: add GitHub Actions to deploy Modal on push to `main`
- Add MCP tool to fetch session `generate_summary`
- Add automated tests for different payload scenarios

### Resolved Issues (This Session)
- ✅ **Modal Integration**: Fixed automatic offloading via LANGDB environment variable
- ✅ **o4-mini-high Parameters**: Resolved max_tokens error with max_completion_tokens implementation
- ✅ **Response Parsing**: Fixed Modal result processing to return rich LangDB data
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Resolved propagation issues with always-on Modal logic

### Remaining Known Issues
- No standard JSON-RPC field to force client auto-follow-up (design limitation)
- Some clients may still not poll on accepted responses (workaround available)
