# Progress

### Status
- Memory bank initialized
- Plan grounded and captured in context docs
- Project scaffolded; server running locally

### Completed
- TS Fastify server with SSE + stdio stub and JSON-RPC root
- Endpoints: `/health`, `/capabilities`, `/sequential`, `/server-info`, `/sse`, JSON-RPC `/`
- In-memory sequential-thinking: `/process_thought`, `/generate_summary`, `/clear_history`, `/run`
- Modal GPU app deployed with webhook (HMAC) and local smoke tests
- Cursor MCP config updated; server integrated
- Finalized per-step behavior parity: removed `auto` and `auto_chain` from JSON-RPC; minimal per-step returns
- Guardrails added: rate limiting, input caps, structured error objects
- Fixed protocol compliance: `protocolVersion` and `inputSchema` casing
- Repository pushed to GitHub: `https://github.com/knath2000/ai-sequential-thinking` (`main`)
- In-Cursor validation: 3 `sequential_thinking` tool calls recorded successfully
- GitHub pushes for all changes

### Next
- Wire provider client (LangDB Claude et al.) and Perplexity enrichment in orchestrator path
- Railway deploy, then test in Cursor Agent mode both flows

### Known Issues
- No standard JSON-RPC field to force client auto-follow-up; rely on Agent mode or single-call auto
