# Progress

### Status
- Memory bank initialized
- Plan grounded and captured in context docs
- Project scaffolded; server running locally

### Completed
- productContext, projectbrief, systemPatterns, techContext, activeContext created
- TS Fastify server with SSE + stub stdio
- Endpoints: `/health`, `/capabilities`, `/sequential`
- In-memory sequential-thinking: `/process_thought`, `/generate_summary`, `/clear_history`, `/run`
- Perplexity grounding used to select model matrix (default GPT-4o/o1; quality Opus 4; cost Gemini 2.5/DeepSeek; self-host Llama/Mistral)

### Next
- Implement Claude (LangDB) client and Perplexity tool wrappers
- Orchestrate sequential tool streaming and tool-calls
- Provider switch for model choices
- E2E test with grounding and strict JSON streaming

### Known Issues
- stdio transport not yet implemented
- Orchestration currently mocked; no model calls yet
