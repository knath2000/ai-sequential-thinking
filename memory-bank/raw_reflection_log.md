TaskRef: "Scaffold server, implement endpoints, ground model selection"

Learnings:
- Minimal viable endpoints (`/health`, `/capabilities`, `/sequential`) speed up local verification.
- Adding `/process_thought`, `/generate_summary`, `/clear_history` supports immediate UX for sequential flows prior to model integration.
- Model landscape (Aug 2025): default GPT-4o/o1; quality-first Claude Opus 4; cost Gemini 2.5/DeepSeek; self-host Llama/Mistral.

Difficulties:
- None; SSE scaffolding straightforward.

Successes:
- Server boots; SSE smoke test successful; summary pipeline returns expected structure.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Provider switch pattern for routing requests by task type.
- JSON streaming repair middleware to ensure strict blocks during partial outputs.
