TaskRef: "Build live analytics dashboard, fix CORS/auth, and instrument logging"

Learnings:
- SvelteKit + Tailwind + Flowbite is a fast path to a modern dashboard; ECharts can be added for trends.
- Use SSE for live KPI tiles; provide REST time-series for historical charts. Mount static build under `/dashboard`.
- For local dev, a Vite proxy (`/api` → Railway host) eliminates CORS; default API base to `/api` in dev.
- FastAPI CORS must allow localhost ports (5173/3000) and production host; SSE works fine once allowed origins are set.
- Starlette `StaticFiles` should be guarded: resolve absolute path and skip mount if dir missing to avoid boot crashes.
- Request logging middleware is invaluable on Railway to trace REQ/RES lines and status codes.
- 403s on analytics were due to auth; adding `X-Analytics-Ingest-Key` header support (with optional bearer) unblocked ingestion.
- Tool-side analytics client should enable by default: default backend URL to Railway and accept either bearer or ingest key.

Difficulties:
- Initial CORS and 403s blocked dev; Vite proxy + ingest key path resolved both without interactive auth.
- SSE path worked but dashboard build wasn’t mounted on server; added guarded mount and base path.

Successes:
- Live dashboard updating via SSE; analytics POSTs visible in Railway logs.
- Local dev proxy and production config co-exist cleanly; no CORS errors.
- Sequential_thinking runs now reflect in requests/min, success rate, and cost (when logged).

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Pattern: Provide an ingest header (e.g., `X-Analytics-Ingest-Key`) for non-interactive analytics writes; make bearer optional when header matches.
- Pattern: In dev, proxy API via Vite and set frontend API base to `/api`; in prod, use same-origin `/api/v1` or env override.
- Pattern: Always add a lightweight REQ/RES logging middleware in FastAPI during active development.

TaskRef: "Railway crash: StaticFiles mount failing due to missing 'static' dir"

Learnings:
- Uvicorn/Starlette raises RuntimeError at import time if `StaticFiles(directory=...)` points to a non-existent folder.
- Relative paths differ in container; resolving static path via `Path(__file__).parent.parent / 'static'` is robust for `admin-backend/app/main.py`.
- Skipping the mount when the directory is absent prevents boot crashes in ephemeral builds (Railway), enabling app to start.

Difficulties:
- Logs showed immediate crash loops; needed to guard the mount and log a warning instead.

Successes:
- Implemented existence check and safe mount with absolute path; added logging. Pushed fix to trigger Railway redeploy.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Pattern: Always guard static mounts in FastAPI/Starlette apps; resolve absolute path and skip if missing to avoid startup failures in production containers.

TaskRef: "Finalize per-step behavior, add guardrails, prep provider switch"

Learnings:
- Client (Cursor Agent) controls chaining; minimal per-step tool results avoid protocol ambiguities.
- Simple in-memory rate limiting per session/IP is sufficient for dev; expose window/max via env.
- Input length caps on `thought` prevent accidental payload bloat and improve stability.

Difficulties:
- Prior auto/auto_chain paths caused confusion in JSON-RPC semantics; removed for parity.

Successes:
- Standardized JSON-RPC tool response to minimal content block; added structured errors consistently.
- SSE now streams basic step updates; ready to swap in provider-driven events.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Pattern: Prefer per-step minimal returns for MCP tools; let orchestrators or clients handle chaining.
- Guardrails: Rate limit + input caps + structured error envelope.

TaskRef: "Harden /diag/langdb, add route debugging, and push fixes"

Learnings:
- Changing diag routes from GET to POST requires clear fallbacks for browser users; a GET hint endpoint reduces confusion.
- Validating request bodies and logging a truncated raw payload accelerates diagnosing JSON parsing issues.
- Increasing default diagnostic timeouts (30s) reduces false negatives from slower upstreams.
- Adding `/routes` makes route registration issues immediately visible in deployed environments.

Difficulties:
- Initial TypeScript errors arose from accessing properties on untyped `object`; resolved with a request body interface and type assertion.
- A 404 for GET `/diag/langdb` after switching to POST created confusion; GET fallback resolved developer experience.

Successes:
- Build passed after fixes; endpoint works with POST and provides actionable error messages on invalid payloads.
- Changes pushed to GitHub; validated in Cursor with sequential_thinking tool functioning as expected.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Pattern: For diagnostic endpoints, always provide a GET fallback hinting correct usage and example payload.
- Pattern: Include `/routes` or equivalent route introspection endpoint during active development.

TaskRef: "Push to GitHub and validate MCP tool inside Cursor"

Learnings:
- Verifying MCP from inside Cursor confirms per-step parity works with Agent-driven chaining.
- Recording steps without heavy payloads keeps tool latency low and avoids client ambiguities.

Difficulties:
- None significant; ensured rate limiting didn’t interfere with rapid test calls.

Successes:
- Pushed repo to GitHub (`main`).
- Three sequential_thinking calls returned `{ ok: true, status: "recorded" }` in Cursor chat.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Testing workflow: Prefer direct tool calls in Cursor for MCP validation after server updates.

TaskRef: "Ensure LangDB usage and implement Modal-offloaded flow"

Learnings:
- Server-side envs must be set on Railway; client `~/.cursor/mcp.json` envs do not affect the server.
- Explicit diagnostics endpoints (`/diag`, `/diag/langdb`) accelerate env/probe verification.
- For reliability: timeouts, retries, and correlation IDs are essential when offloading to Modal.

Difficulties:
- Intermittent 502 were from server not responding (timeouts) and missing env in the deployed instance.
- Early LangDB calls returned stub due to missing env/varying URL shapes.

Successes:
- Added LangDB client with robust URL assembly and API key/project handling; source reporting improved.
- Implemented Modal-only LangDB path with webhook + poll; deployed Modal app and obtained submit URL.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Pattern: add `/diag` endpoints for env previews and active probes in production.
- Offload design: accept→poll pattern with webhook, correlation IDs, and HMAC signing.

TaskRef: "Fix Cursor hang: ensure content[] mapping, increase sync window, add poll script"

Learnings:
- Cursor often expects tool results in `content[]` blocks; returning custom top-level fields can result in hidden outputs.
- Increasing server sync wait (120s) and simplifying LLM prompt/model helps keep flows synchronous.
- Providing a manual polling script unblocks clients lacking native polling on accepted async jobs.

Difficulties:
- Async path returned accepted but Cursor didn’t poll; results persisted yet not shown.

Successes:
- Wrapped results in `content[]` text for both completed/accepted; Cursor now displays results directly.
- Modal worker timeout increased to 1800s; prompt simplified; model defaulted to `gpt-4o-mini` for speed.
- End-to-end verified in Cursor with `use_langdb:true` (correlation_id observed).

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Pattern: Always return MCP tool outputs as `content[]` with text in Cursor contexts.
- Add poll helper and document `/modal/job/:id`.

TaskRef: "Enhance sequential_thinking: recommendations, history trimming, recommender & Modal integration"

Learnings:
- Implemented a richer sequential thinking output schema (`SequentialThinkingOutput`) with `current_step` and `recommended_tools` to mirror `mcp-sequentialthinking-tools` patterns.
- Cursor requires tool outputs wrapped in `content[]` with `{ type: 'text', text: JSON.stringify(payload) }` to display results reliably; we preserved that in JSON-RPC responses.
- Added configurable history limits (`MAX_HISTORY_SIZE`) and implemented trimming to keep memory bounded.
- Modal offload helper (`buildModalPayloadForLangdb`) centralizes LangDB payload assembly and enforces model/env defaults for reliable offload runs.
- Created a lightweight `recommender` module that queries LangDB (or falls back to heuristics) to produce `RecommendedTool` entries with `confidence`, `rationale`, and `priority`.
- Added `USE_ENHANCED_SCHEMA` flag to toggle between minimal per-step returns and enhanced structured outputs for backward compatibility.

Difficulties:
- Parsing and normalizing LLM outputs reliably is non-trivial; recommender currently uses a safe fallback heuristic while we iterate on prompts and parsing.

Successes:
- Implemented types, progress trimming, recommender stub, Modal payload helper, Router integration, SSE enrichment, and README docs.
- Committed and pushed changes to `origin/main` (commit `62d30c5`), adding `src/recommender.ts` and updates across `src/*`.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Iterate on recommender prompts to return structured `RecommendedTool` JSON directly from LangDB and parse it safely.
- Add unit tests and CI to validate schema, recommender parsing, and Modal offload behavior.
- Document `USE_ENHANCED_SCHEMA`, `MAX_HISTORY_SIZE`, and `AVAILABLE_MCP_TOOLS` in `.env.example` and README.

TaskRef: "Add cost tracking, dashboard widget, auth fixes, and deployment stability fixes"

Learnings:
- Instrumented LangDB calls to estimate token usage and log cost events via the existing analytics client (`analyticsClient.logLangDBCost`). Added `LANGDB_PRICE_PER_1K` env var for simple cost estimation.
- Instrumented Modal job submissions and webhook callbacks to log Modal cost information when available (`analyticsClient.logModalCost`).
- Extended analytics backend: added `cost_tracking` unique constraint to prevent duplicates and made `create_cost_tracking` idempotent.
- Exposed analytics endpoints: `/api/v1/analytics/costs` (list), `/api/v1/analytics/costs/summary` (aggregations). Added `AuthFailure` model and `/api/v1/analytics/auth-failure` helper endpoint for auth logging.
- Implemented a `CostSummaryWidget.svelte` in the Svelte dashboard and integrated it into the dashboard page; fetches `/analytics/costs/summary` using `admin-dashboard/src/lib/api.ts` which now attaches `X-Analytics-Ingest-Key` from `VITE_ANALYTICS_INGEST_KEY`.
- Fixed TypeScript issues in Node code (modalClient typing) and successfully ran `pnpm build`.
- Resolved a `NameError: Dict` by importing `Dict` and `Any` (and/or replacing with modern `dict[str, Any]`) in `admin-backend/app/api/endpoints/analytics.py`.
- Improved authentication flow: changed `get_cost_summary` to depend on `get_ingest_or_user` so the ingest key is accepted; added optional dev auth bypass via `ALLOW_DEV_AUTH_BYPASS` for local testing.

Difficulties:
- Initial TypeScript build failed due to typing mismatch in `modalClient.ts`; fixed by normalizing `session_id` to string when logging.
- Deployment crash caused by missing `Dict` import required careful type hint fixes.

Successes:
- Full instrumentation for cost events for LangDB and Modal; backend stores cost entries and prevents duplicates.
- Dashboard widget added and integrated; client now sends ingest key header automatically.
- Backend enhanced with auth-failure logging, middleware to capture 401s, and developer convenience flags for local testing.
- All changes committed and pushed; builds succeed locally (TypeScript) and changes pushed to `origin/main`.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Add unit and integration tests for cost logging and for the `auth_failure` logging flow.
- Add dashboard UI charts for historical cost trends and alerts for spikes.
- Harden dev bypass logic and document `ALLOW_DEV_AUTH_BYPASS` usage clearly in README.

TaskRef: "Implement JSON-RPC MCP server, Cursor integration, and auto-orchestrator"

Learnings:
- Cursor/mcp-remote expects JSON-RPC `protocolVersion` and camelCase `inputSchema`; notifications/initialized should be 204
- No standard JSON field to trigger automatic follow-up; Agent mode drives chaining
- Third-party sequentialthinking-tools returns minimal per-step metadata; Cursor auto-advances without proposed fields
- Two viable patterns: single-call auto aggregation (server orchestrates) vs per-step minimal (agent orchestrates)

Difficulties:
- Initial 404s (POST /, SSE) and schema errors (protocolVersion, inputSchema) blocked mcp-remote
- Auto-prompt was not triggered by our custom proposed field; not recognized by Cursor

Successes:
- Fixed transport and protocol compliance; local JSON-RPC tests pass
- Added auto_orchestrator and auto_chain; Modal worker deployed; webhook verified
- GitHub repo pushed; Cursor config updated; tools show up

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Decide final orchestration mode and standardize outputs
- Add guardrails (rate limit, sanitization) and provider switch

TaskRef: "MCP sequential_thinking — GPT-5-mini migration & Cursor integration"

Learnings:
- Cursor requires `content[]` objects with explicit `type` (e.g., `{ type: 'text', text: '...' }`) for tool outputs to display reliably; returning only custom top-level fields can hide results.
- LangDB model switching must be enforced across all execution paths (router payloads, Modal offload, LangDB client). Environment variables alone can be overridden by defaults; explicitly include `model` in payloads sent to Modal.
- Newer GPT-5-family models use different parameter names (`max_completion_tokens` vs `max_tokens`) and stricter allowed values (e.g., `temperature` often must be default `1`). Implement model-aware param mapping and filtering.
- Deploying Modal worker for LangDB offload simplifies GPU/long-running calls but requires careful payload propagation and HMAC-signed callbacks.

Difficulties:
- Multiple code paths (local client, router, Modal worker) had inconsistent defaults leading to fallback to `gpt-4o`.
- Modal deployment initially failed due to a Python indentation error — resolved by fixing the worker.

Successes:
- Implemented `content[]` wrapping in `src/router.ts` and returned `type: 'text'` for Cursor compatibility.
- Updated `src/providers/langdbClient.ts` to default to `gpt-5-mini`, add dynamic token param mapping (use `max_completion_tokens` for GPT-5), and model-aware param filtering (omit `temperature`/`top_p` for GPT-5 unless opted-in via `LANGDB_ALLOW_NONDEFAULT_TEMPERATURE`).
- Updated `modal_app.py` to default to `gpt-5-mini`, enforce the same param filtering, add payload logging, and deployed it to Modal.
- Tested end-to-end: `sequential_thinking` with `use_langdb=true` completed successfully and returned mirrored responses in Cursor.
- Committed and pushed all changes to `origin main` and created a memory entry for tracking.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Add `LANGDB_ALLOW_NONDEFAULT_TEMPERATURE` to `.env.example` with clear docs.
- Add a post-deploy checklist: verify env vars in deployment platform (Railway/Modal) and run `/diag/langdb`.
- Add more robust integration tests that validate payloads sent to LangDB via Modal (mock or staging).

TaskRef: "Complete Modal integration with o4-mini-high support and rich LangDB response parsing"

Learnings:
- Fixed Modal integration by changing logic from checking explicit use_langdb parameter to always-on Modal offloading by default
- Resolved o4-mini-high model compatibility by implementing max_completion_tokens parameter support for o1-series models in langdbClient.ts
- Fixed Modal result processing to properly extract and return LangDB step descriptions instead of hardcoded basic responses
- Environment variable propagation issue solved by implementing server-side always-on Modal logic rather than relying on client-side LANGDB env var
- LangDB returns rich step arrays with step_description and progress_pct that can be converted to intelligent tool recommendations
- Railway auto-deployment works seamlessly with GitHub pushes for continuous integration

Difficulties:
- Initial Modal integration appeared working but was only returning basic fallback responses instead of rich LangDB data
- o4-mini-high model failed with "max_tokens not supported" error requiring parameter name change to max_completion_tokens
- Environment variable from mcp.json (client-side) does not propagate to Railway server, requiring server-side logic changes
- Modal webhook results were being ignored and replaced with hardcoded response structure

Successes:
- Complete end-to-end validation with rich responses including detailed step descriptions, progress tracking, and tool recommendations
- Modal integration now fully operational with automatic offloading and comprehensive debug logging
- o4-mini-high model working correctly with proper parameter support and no fallback to other models
- Enhanced response format with current_step, recommended_tools, remaining_steps, and modal_processing metadata
- Production-ready deployment with Railway auto-deployment from GitHub

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Pattern: For o1-series models, always use max_completion_tokens parameter and omit temperature/top_p parameters
- Pattern: When implementing Modal offloading, always process and return the actual webhook result rather than fallback responses
- Pattern: Server-side environment-based feature flags are more reliable than client-side parameter passing for default behaviors
- Railway-GitHub auto-deployment pattern works well for continuous integration and testing

TaskRef: "Session detail modal, auto-close, worker restart, 500 fix & CORS headers"

Learnings:
- Adding a nullable `session_id` column to metrics tables makes per-session retrieval simple and avoids brittle JSON tag lookups.
- Always `session.rollback()` after a failed SQLAlchemy query to clear the "current transaction is aborted" state; otherwise every subsequent query in the same request fails with 500.
- Wrapping expensive optional queries (metrics) in try/except keeps the endpoint functional even if one part fails.
- Global exception handler plus Starlette `CORSMiddleware` guarantees 500 JSON bodies with proper CORS headers – prevents the browser from showing misleading CORS‐missing errors.
- Svelte modal inactivity timer can attach document-level listeners and must clear them on destroy to avoid memory leaks and HMR warnings.
- Frontend endpoint paths should include the same prefix (`/analytics`) used in backend routers to avoid 404.

Difficulties:
- Neon returned `current transaction is aborted` after the initial invalid JSON-lookup query, breaking subsequent log queries.
- Browser showed CORS 500 because the unhandled exception prevented CORSMiddleware from adding headers.

Successes:
- Session detail view works: metadata, events, metrics, logs.
- Modal closes automatically after 5 min idle; logs pane still streams.
- Restarted Modal worker with `modal deploy` and confirmed GPU function live.
- Fixed 500s by rolling back session and simplifying metric query; verified 200/404 responses.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Pattern: always rollback the DB session inside except blocks before issuing additional queries.
- Pattern: expose nullable foreign-key-ish columns (e.g., `session_id`) for common lookup paths even if JSON tags exist.
- Pattern: global exception handler + CORSMiddleware ensures consistent JSON error responses across environments.
