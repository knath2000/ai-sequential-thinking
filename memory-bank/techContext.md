# Tech Context

### Stack
- Node.js (>= 18), TypeScript
- Fastify for HTTP + SSE
- Axios for HTTP clients
- Dotenv for env loading

### Key Env Vars
- `LANGDB_BASEURL` (e.g., https://gateway.langdb.ai)
- `LANGDB_KEY`
- `PERPLEXITY_ASK_URL` (e.g., http://localhost:5000)
- `PORT` (default 3000)
- `TRANSPORT` ("sse" or "stdio")
- `RAILWAY_ANALYTICS_URL` (URL of your Railway app's /api/v1/analytics/costs endpoint)
- `RAILWAY_ANALYTICS_KEY` (Your analytics ingest key, passed as a Modal secret)

### Dev Commands (planned)
- Install: `npm i fastify axios dotenv`
- Dev: `npx ts-node src/index.ts`
- Test SSE: `curl -N "http://localhost:3000/sequential?query=..."`
- Build: `tsc`

### Security Notes
- HTTPS in production for outbound requests
- Do not log secrets; redact on errors
- Basic rate-limits per IP/route recommended

### Compatibility
- MCP tool schema compatible with Claude Desktop
- stdio fallback for environments without HTTP

## Calling the `sequential_thinking` Tool in Cursor

I was able to call the `sequential_thinking` tool directly within Cursor without requiring your input or terminal access by utilizing an enabled and attached tool function.

Here's how this was achieved:

1.  **Direct Tool Invocation**: Instead of using terminal commands like `curl` or requesting you to manually interact with the UI, I directly invoked the `mcp_ai_sequential_thinking_sequential_thinking` function. This function is an abstract representation of the `sequential_thinking` tool that Cursor provides to me.

2.  **Internal Cursor Mechanism**: Cursor's architecture allows me, as the AI assistant, to interact with enabled tools directly through their programmatic interfaces. This means that once a tool like `sequential_thinking` is enabled and attached (which you confirmed it was), I can call its corresponding function (`mcp_ai_sequential_thinking_sequential_thinking` in this case) with the required parameters.

3.  **No Terminal or User Interaction**: This direct invocation bypasses the need for me to execute `curl` commands in a terminal or for you to type `@sequential_thinking` in the chat interface. It's a programmatic call made by me to the underlying tool provided by Cursor.

4.  **Error Trigger**: To demonstrate the error logging, I intentionally provided an incomplete set of arguments to the `mcp_ai_sequential_thinking_sequential_thinking` function, specifically omitting `next_thought_needed`. This caused the tool to report a missing parameter error, which you can now verify in your NeonDB error logs.

In essence, Cursor provides me with direct access to interact with its enabled tools, enabling a seamless and automated workflow for tasks like calling the `sequential_thinking` tool.
